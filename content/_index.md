## What is <span class="fab">p5.fab</span>?
<span class="fab">p5.fab</span> is a Javscript library to control digital fabrication machines. It's made for creative coders and makers across skill levels to make physical things using code. At it's core, <span class="fab">p5.fab</span> lets you write Javascript code to control machines; it also supports interactive control of machines during execution and documentation of material output. You can use <span class="fab">p5.fab</span> to:

  - make generative artifacts;
  - explore and tune machine settings;
  - quickly iterate on designs without reverting to CAD/CAM software;
  - learn about how your machine works;
  - experiment with new materials;
  - develop interactive fabrication workflows;
  - and whatever else you can think of!

<span class='fab'>p5.fab</span> is developed as a library for <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. This site provides resources to use <span class='fab'>p5.fab</span>, including a gentle introduction to both creative coding and digital fabrication.

## Required Materials
While you _can_ get started with <span class='fab'>p5.fab</span> without a machine, it is designed to be used to explore material behaviour. Currently, the library supports 3D printers running Marlin firmware and has been tested on the following machines: Ender3 v2, Prusa i3-mk3, Potterbot 9, and FLSUN Q9. Development for other machines including CNCs and plotters are ongoing. If this doesn't mean much to you--or you want more information--see the <a href="docs/machine-compatibility"> machine compatibility page</a>.
